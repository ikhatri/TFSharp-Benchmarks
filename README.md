# TFSharp-Benchmarks
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network to classify the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset in both Python (using Keras wrapping TensorFlow) and in C# using TensorFlow Sharp to wrap TensorFlow.

The purpose of these benchmarks are to serve as a basic usibility test and example for TensorFlow Sharp.
